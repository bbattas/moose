# Navier Stokes Turbulence / WCNSFVTurbulencePhysics

!syntax description /Physics/NavierStokes/Turbulence/WCNSFVTurbulencePhysics

## Coupling with other Physics

A turbulence model can be added to a heat advection solve by using both a `WCNSFVTurbulencePhysics` and a [WCNSFVFluidHeatTransferPhysics.md].
The following input performs this coupling for weakly compressible flow in a 2D channel.
No system parameters are passed, so the equations are solved in a fully coupled manner in the same [nonlinear system](systems/NonlinearSystem.md).
